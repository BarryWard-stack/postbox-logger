## 1. Core Heritage Organizations
These groups provide the research-grade data required for Phase 3 (Data Provenance):

* **Letter Box Study Group (LBSG):** The definitive authority on UK postboxes. They maintain a directory of ~115,500 boxes.
* **The Postal Museum:** Primary archive for historical standardization and technical evolution.
* **Historic England / Cadw / Historic Environment Scotland:** Parties to the Joint Policy Statement (JPS) ensuring the conservation of postboxes in situ.

## 2. Technical Identification & Rarity Tiers
Use these tiers to calibrate the Phase 2 Gamification (Points & Achievements):

| Era / Type | Cipher | Rarity | Points (Target) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Edward VIII** | E VIII R | Legendary | 500+ |
| **Charles III** | C III R | Very Rare | 250 |
| **Penfold Hexagonal** | VR (1866-79)| High | 200 |
| **Anonymous Pillar** | None (1879-87)| Rare | 150 |
| **Olympic Gold** | E II R (Gold) | Special | 100 |
| **Victorian Standard**| VR | Medium | 75 |
| **Elizabeth II** | E II R | Standard | 10 |

## 4. Key Data Fields for Curation
To ensure research-grade integrity, all entries must validate the following:

1.  **Cipher Accuracy:** Matching the physical cipher (e.g., GR vs G VI R) to the correct historical era.
2.  **EXIF Verification:** Cross-referencing photo metadata (timestamp/GPS) with user input.
3.  **Manufacturer Marks:** Identifying foundries (e.g., Handyside, Carron Company) where possible.
